We propose a method aiming at giving the possibility to a robot, to understand by interacting with its environment, which parts belong to moving objects and which ones belong to the background. The originality of this approach is the use of very few hypotheses in order to allow better generalization in the most diverse environments. The novelty comes from the use of a persistent segmentation of the scene giving the possibility to follow each part of the scene and to better understand the boundary of each object.\\   The benefit of this method is that it provides a solid basis for using an affordance map to understand which actions are possible for each part of the environment. Thus, once the robot is able to understand how and where to interact with its environment, it will be easier to make it perform a more complex set of tasks.
